# MCQ_Checker - Personal Project

## Introduction
- This project is a simple python script that checks multiple choice questions (MCQs) from a text file and returns the correct answers.
- The user is provided with a minimalistic question attempting interface with a timer and a permanent record of the questions attempted.
- Essentially the user needs to provide a text file with all the answers to the MCQs in a minimal format i.e. only the answers in a consecutive string which is then later used in analysis and checking.

## Background
- I developed this in my early days of Learning python and programming in general.
- My university examinations were around and I needed to prepare for them. I had a lot of MCQs to solve and I thought of automating the process.
- Natively I had physical textbooks with explanations and answers to the MCQs; but revisiting every question considering Bitsat had 300 in total was a tedious task.
- So I thought of writing a script that would take the MCQs from a text file and return a brief report with stats like accuracy and questions to revisit along with subject vise analysis.
- I used this script to check my answers and it helped me a lot in revising the concepts.

## How to use
- (I doubt anybody would ever use this on their own local machine; but here's the 'HOW to')
- You can clone the entire repo; but in reality all the necessary code that you need is the 1. main_modified.py and 2. data.py
- Other necessary files include the answer key text file and the permanent record text file; the former is to be provided by the user and the later will be created after the first run and appended ahead.
- Checkout the previous solution files to get the gist of the format.
